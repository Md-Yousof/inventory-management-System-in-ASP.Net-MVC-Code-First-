	Description: In "Inventory Control System with ASP.NET MVC," I led the development of a robust inventory management tool using a
		     Database First approach. Integrated key features such as real-time email alerts, relational functionalities, AJAX partial views,
		     and modal pop-ups for enhanced user experience. Demonstrated expertise in model creation, efficient database connections via 
		     Entity Framework, and seamless UI with Bootstrap and JavaScript. A testament to my skills in software architecture, database
		     integration, and building user-friendly web applications.
