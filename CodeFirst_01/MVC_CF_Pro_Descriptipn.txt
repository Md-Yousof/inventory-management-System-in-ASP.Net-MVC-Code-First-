
In "Inventory Control System with ASP.NET MVC," I led the development of a robust inventory management tool using a Database First approach. Integrated key features such as real-time email alerts, relational functionalities, AJAX partial views, and modal pop-ups for enhanced user experience. Demonstrated expertise in model creation, efficient database connections via Entity Framework, and seamless UI with Bootstrap and JavaScript. A testament to my skills in software architecture, database integration, and building user-friendly web applications.
